I have not decided which FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) licence to use, so I released these files with all rights reserved.

If you think one of my files could help you, please contact me by submitting a GitHub issue and tell me which FOSS license you want.

Some files have copyright notice at the top of that file. If so, that copyright notice (instead of this copyright notice) will apply to that file.
